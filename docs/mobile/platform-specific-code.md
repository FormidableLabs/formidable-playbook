## Mobile Playbook: Platform-specific code

#### Prefer to separate `*.ios.js` and `*.android.js` component files over switching on `Platform.*`

#### Prefer to split UI into smaller components until lowest common denominator.

#### If applicable, separate only styles into `*.styles.ios.js` and `*.styles.android.js` to avoid duplication of code

#### Prefer pure JS implementation over custom native components for maintainability

#### Prefer to wrap native platform UI components to achieve native look-and-feel over implementing from scratch

#### Managing native dependencies (npm vs Maven/CocoaPods/Carthage)

#### Patterns for authoring native modules
