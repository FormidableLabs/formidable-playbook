=======================

A practical guide for modern applications. Learn how to survive the frontend,
backend, and beyond.

## The Architecture Playbook

### [Have a single infrastructure](docs/infrastructure/single.md)

A unified development effort should use a single infrastructure to control all
similar projects.

## The Frontend Playbook

Our frontend infrastructure is based around [webpack][] builds, but most of the
guidelines / goals apply to any build tool.

### Webpack plugins

#### [Start with good base plugins](docs/frontend/webpack-plugins.md)

Webpack has a rich plugin ecosystem, including both
[core](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html) and
[open source](http://nipstr.com/#webpack plugin)
[modules](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/webpack-plugin) modules.
Webpack also has a straight forward interface to
[write your own plugins](https://webpack.github.io/docs/plugins.html).

A short list of plugin recommendations for best frontend performance include:

| Plugin | Recommend? | Notes |
| ------ | ---------- | ----- |
| [`UglifyJsPlugin`](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#uglifyjsplugin)| Yes | Minimize code |
| [`DedupePlugin`](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#dedupeplugin)| Yes | Collapse identical code chunks to a single reference |
| [`lodash-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/lodash/lodash-webpack-plugin)| Yes | Optimize `lodash` (if used) |
| [`OccurrenceOrderPlugin`](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#occurrenceorderplugin)| Maybe | Reorder module and chunk ids by occurrence count |
| [`DefinePlugin`](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#defineplugin)| Maybe | Define constants for better optimization |

**TODO: Write up doc**
**TODO: OccurrenceOrderPlugin - determinism, watch min+gz**
**TODO: DefinePlugin - `process.env.NODE_ENV = production`**

#### [Code splitting](docs/frontend/webpack-code-splitting.md)

**TODO: Write up intro section / doc**

#### [Shared libraries](docs/frontend/webpack-shared-libs.md)

**TODO: Write up intro section / doc**

* https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#dllplugin
  ([example](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples/dll))
* https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#dllreferenceplugin
  ([example](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples/dll-user))


#### [Source maps](docs/frontend/webpack-source-maps.md)

**TODO: Write up intro section / doc**: Get dev / prod friendly sourcemaps

### Other tools

**TODO: tools -- little-loader for script loading**

### Performance auditing

**TODO: inspectpack reports, audits**
