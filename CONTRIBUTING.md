Contributing
============

* Before opening a PR, be sure to run `npm run build`. We **commit** built
  examples to this repository because they're small and meant to be read.
* The build also automatically generates the Markdown TOCs in each file using
  `doctoc`. Please do not manually update TOCs or the control comments for
  `doctoc`.
