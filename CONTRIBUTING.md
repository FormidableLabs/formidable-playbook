Contributing
============

* Before opening a PR, be sure to run `npm run build`. We **commit** built
  examples to this repository because they're small and meant to be read.
* Most Markdown files use the `MarkdownTOC` Sublime Text extension to
  automagically update the TOC's in each document. Please edit your TOCs
  manually if not using the plugin.
